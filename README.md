# SecOps Llama Agents

This project implements a Security Operations (SecOps) system using Llama Agents, providing advanced network analysis, threat detection, and log analysis capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secops-llama-agents.git
   cd secops-llama-agents
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python secops_llama_agents.py
   ```

2. The system will start and display a message indicating that it's running.

3. To interact with the system, open a new terminal and use the following command:
   ```
   llama-agents monitor --control-plane-url http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

4. You can now send commands to the system through the monitor. For example:
   ```
   analyze network traffic for the last 5 minutes
   ```

## Available Commands

The SecOps Llama Agents system provides the following capabilities:

- Capture and analyze network traffic
- Detect threats using Yara rules
- Perform vulnerability assessments
- Analyze log data for security events

You can interact with these capabilities by sending natural language commands through the monitor.

## Configuration

You can modify the `secops_llama_agents.py` file to adjust the following:

- LLM model: Change the `model` parameter in the `Groq` initialization.
- Embedding model: Modify the `model_name` in the `HuggingFaceEmbedding` initialization.
- Agent tools: Add or remove tools in the `tools` list.
- Network interface: Change the default interface in the `capture_network_traffic` function.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission errors when capturing network traffic, try running the script with sudo privileges.
- Ensure that your Groq API key is correctly set in the `.env` file.
- Check that all required dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`)
6. Create a new Pull Request
